Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,057
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           711 out of   1,057   67%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of   1,057    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         343 out of   1,057   32%

      to control set restrictions:              13 out of 106,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   2

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "disp_mode<2>" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "disp_mode<2>" is not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network fsm_ts<159> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 31 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   fsm_ts<158>,
   fsm_ts<157>,
   fsm_ts<156>,
   fsm_ts<155>,
   fsm_ts<154>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
